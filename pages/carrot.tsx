      <h3>Here a carrot poem in Kalevala style</h3>
      <p>
        In the lands of verdant fields so wide,
        <br />
        Where sunlit meadows stretch with pride,
        <br />
        There dwells a veggie, bold and bright,
        <br />A marvel, orange, a pure delight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, carrot, root of vibrant hue,
        <br />
        With sweetness and crunch, ever true.
        <br />
        Beneath the earth, your secret lies,
        <br />
        Nourished by nature, a tasty prize.
      </p>

      <p>
        From humble seed to tender growth,
        <br />
        You rise above, displaying both
        <br />
        A robust nature, strong and fine,
        <br />A vegetable so divine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carved by nature's patient hand,
        <br />
        In soups and salads, you command.
        <br />
        A burst of flavor with each bite,
        <br />
        Carrot, you bring pure delight.
      </p>
